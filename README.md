# My Matlab project for Numerical Methods 1  

I realized I had every version of the project manually saved lmfao  
so thought I might as well transfer the history to git/Github

### TODO:

Generalize testing further:
* "cholTests.m" into a function
* loop over the function to generate lots of matrices automatically
* test wide and narrow ranges
